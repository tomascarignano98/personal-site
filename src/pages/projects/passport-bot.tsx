        Passport Bot is a little program I wrote to get myself an appointment at
        the Spanish Consulate of Cordoba, Argentina.

          The project came to be as a solution to a niche problem in my life: we
          were in the middle of the pandemic, and getting an appointment for
          renewing my Spanish passport was virtually impossible; the website
          would provide new slots on specific days at 00:00, and every time I
          tried to fill a spot, I would get a popup saying it was already taken.
          This happened to me around 4 times before I realized it was a speed
          problem, so I decided to solve it with code. This was important for me
          because I was planning to move to Europe the following year.
        </p>
        <p>
          The expected outcome was that the bot would open the browser, go to
          the site, pick a free spot, and fill out the forms. All done at
          computer speed, rather than human speed.

          I started with repeating the task manually, but this time around,
          copying the entire HTML content of every page with the use of{' '}
          <ChromeDevToolsLink />. After that, I recreated the website in my
          computer and then coded the script with the help of this mocked
          version of the website. Finally, I added the real url, waited for the
          next opportunity, and voil√†.
